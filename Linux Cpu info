CPU hardware information

The cpu information includes details about the processor, like the architecture, vendor name, model, number of cores, speed of each core etc. There are quite a few commands on linux to get those details about the cpu hardware, and here is a brief about some of the commands.

1. /proc/cpuinfo

The /proc/cpuinfo file contains details about individual cpu cores. Output its contents with less or cat.

$ less /proc/cpuinfo
processor       : 0
vendor_id       : GenuineIntel
cpu family      : 6
model           : 23
model name      : Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Quad CPU    Q8400  @ 2.66GHz
stepping        : 10
microcode       : 0xa07
cpu MHz         : 1998.000
cache size      : 2048 KB
physical id     : 0
siblings        : 4
core id         : 0
cpu cores       : 4
apicid          : 0
initial apicid  : 0
fpu             : yes
fpu_exception   : yes
cpuid level     : 13
wp              : yes
flags           : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca cmov pat pse36 clflush dts acpi mmx fxsr sse sse2 ss ht tm pbe syscall nx lm constant_tsc arch_perfmon pebs bts rep_good nopl aperfmperf pni dtes64 monitor ds_cpl vmx est tm2 ssse3 cx16 xtpr pdcm sse4_1 xsave lahf_lm dtherm tpr_shadow vnmi flexpriority
bogomips        : 5303.14
clflush size    : 64
cache_alignment : 64
address sizes   : 36 bits physical, 48 bits virtual
power management:

Every processor or core is listed separately the various details about speed, cache size and model name are included in the description.

To count the number of processing units use grep with wc

$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep processor | wc -l
4

The number of processors shown by /proc/cpuinfo might not be the actual number of cores on the processor. For example a processor with 2 cores and hyperthreading would be reported as a processor with 4 cores.

To get the actual number of cores, check the core id for unique values

$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep 'core id'
core id         : 0
core id         : 2
core id         : 1
core id         : 3

So there are 4 different core ids. This indicates that there are 4 actual cores.
2. lscpu

lscpu is a small and quick command that does not need any options. It would simply print the cpu hardware details in a user-friendly format.

$ lscpu
Architecture:          x86_64
CPU op-mode(s):        32-bit, 64-bit
Byte Order:            Little Endian
CPU(s):                4
On-line CPU(s) list:   0-3
Thread(s) per core:    1
Core(s) per socket:    4
Socket(s):             1
NUMA node(s):          1
Vendor ID:             GenuineIntel

L1d cache:             32K
L1i cache:             32K
L2 cache:              2048K
NUMA node0 CPU(s):     0-3

3. hardinfo

Hardinfo is a gtk based gui tool that generates reports about various hardware components. But it can also run from the command line only if there is no gui display available.

$ hardinfo | less

It would produce a large report about many hardware parts, by reading files from the /proc directory. The cpu information is towards the beginning of the report. The report can also be written to a text file.

Hardinfo also performs a few benchmark tests taking a few minutes before the report is displayed.
4. lshw

The lshw command can display limited information about the cpu. lshw by default shows information about various hardware parts, and the '-class' option can be used to pickup information about a specific hardware part.

$ sudo lshw -class processor
  *-cpu                   
       description: CPU

The vendor, model and speed of the processor are being shown correctly. However it is not possible to deduce the number of cores on the processor from the above output.
5. nproc

The nproc command just prints out the number of processing units available. Note that the number of processing units might not always be the same as number of cores.

$ nproc
4

6. dmidecode

The dmidecode command displays some information about the cpu, which includes the socket type, vendor name and various flags.

$ sudo dmidecode -t 4
# dmidecode 2.12
SMBIOS 2.4 present.
